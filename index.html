        <h2>IPL 2020 latest stories:</h2>
        <p>Kings XI Punjab broke their losing streak on Thursday as they returned to winning way with an eight-wicket victory against Royal Challengers Bangalore in Sharjah. The match went down to the last ball, with Nicholas Pooran hitting a six to seal a thrilling win for KXIP. The result had little effect of the points-table but gave KXIP the confidence they’d fallen short of.Karthik was appointed captain of KKR ahead of the 2018 season of the IPL, replacing the side’s long-standing skipper Gautam Gambhir, who joined the Delhi Capitals (then Daredevils) after the franchise opted not to retain him. Karthik captained KKR for two entire seasons of the IPL, guiding the team to the knockouts in 2018 and a fifth-place finish in 2019. This year, KKR are currently placed fourth with eight points after seven matches.</p>

        <p>Anti-viral drug remdesivir has little or no effect in the recovery and mortality of hospitalised Covid-19 patients, said a World Health Organisation (WHO) study, giving a big blow to the hope that the drug from US-based Gilead Sciences raised in combating the pandemic. The study, which spans more than 30 countries, looked at the effects of these treatments on overall mortality, initiation of ventilation, and duration of hospital stay in hospitalised patients.</p>

        <h2>Hindi Film Industry to Shift Out of Mumbai? Maharashtra Govt Locks Horns with BJP:</h2>
        <p>Politics has now begun in Maharashtra over murmurs of shifting of the Hindi film industry out of Mumbai, to Uttar Pradesh. Yesterday, Maharashtra CM Uddhav Thackeray issued a statement saying attempts were being made to malign and shift the Hindi film industry and the same will not be tolerated. The statement assumes significance since it is for the first time the CM has spoken over the ongoing probe in the Sushant Singh Rajput death probe.

Today, senior leader from the NCP and cabinet minister Nawab Malik too responded to the rumours by stating, "Several attempts are being made to defame Bollywood and shift it out of Mumbai, to Uttar Pradesh. We will not allow the same." Last month, UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath had unveiled grand plans of setting up a mega film city, touted to be India's largest, in Uttar Pradesh.</p>
